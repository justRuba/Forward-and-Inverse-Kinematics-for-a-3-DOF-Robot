# Forward and Inverse Kinematics for a 3-DOF Robot

This project explains the forward and inverse kinematics of a 3-DOF planar robot. It includes detailed calculations and an example to illustrate the concepts.

## Forward Kinematics

Forward kinematics involves determining the position and orientation of the end-effector given the joint parameters.

Consider a planar robot with three revolute joints, denoted as 
𝜃
1
θ 
1
​
 , 
𝜃
2
θ 
2
​
 , and 
𝜃
3
θ 
3
​
 . Each joint connects to a link of length 
𝐿
1
L 
1
​
 , 
𝐿
2
L 
2
​
 , and 
𝐿
3
L 
3
​
 , respectively.
