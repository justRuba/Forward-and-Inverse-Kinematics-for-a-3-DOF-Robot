# Forward and Inverse Kinematics for a 3-DOF Robot

This project explains the forward and inverse kinematics of a 3-DOF planar robot. It includes detailed calculations and an example to illustrate the concepts.

## Forward Kinematics

Forward kinematics involves determining the position and orientation of the end-effector given the joint parameters.

### Example: 3-DOF Planar Robot

Consider a planar robot with three revolute joints, Each joint connects to a link of length.

The end-effector's position can be found by summing the contributions of each link.

The position (x,y) of the end-effector is given by:
