# Forward and Inverse Kinematics for a 3-DOF Robot

This project explains the forward and inverse kinematics of a 3-DOF planar robot. It includes detailed calculations and an example to illustrate the concepts.

## Forward Kinematics

Forward kinematics involves determining the position and orientation of the end-effector given the joint parameters.
